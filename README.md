# Discourse Random Usernames

This plugin assigns anonymous usernames without allowing users to create their own.

Settings:
- `random_usernames_length` decides how long the generated usernames will be.
- `random_usernames_alphabet` decides which characters will be used, so it will avoid accidentally generating actual words.
